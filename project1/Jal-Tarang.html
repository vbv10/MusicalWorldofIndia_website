		<text>Description</text> : 
		<p>The Jal-Tarang is a melodic percussion instrument that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It consists of a set of ceramic or metal bowls filled with water. The bowls are played by striking the edge with beaters, one in each hand.When we hit the cup with a stick or finger, water waves are produced due to vibrations in the cup. These vibrations travel through water in the cups and after striking with the surface of the cup, these vibrations produce sound. Due to vibrations low pitch and high pitch sounds are produced.
