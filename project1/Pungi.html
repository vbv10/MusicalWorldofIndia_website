		<text>Description</text> : 
		<p>The Pungi also called the been, is a wind instrument played by snake charmers on the Indian subcontinent. The instrument consists of a mouth-blown air reservoir made from a gourd, which channels air into two reed pipes. The pungi is played with no pauses, with the player employing circular breathing. The pungi originated in India and is still played by snake charmers in street performances.
