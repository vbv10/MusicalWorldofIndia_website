		<text> Description</text> : <p> A Shankha (conch shell) has religious ritual importance in Hinduism.The sound of the shankha symbolises the sacred Om sound. In Hindu mythology, the shankha is a sacred emblem of The Hindu preserver god Vishnu.</p>
		<p>It is the shell of any suitable sea snail which had a hole made for the performers embroshure.The overall shape of the main body of the shell is oblong or conical.The upper portion (the siphonal canal) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the spire) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high tuberculation. In Hinduism, the shiny, white, soft shankha with pointed ends and heavy is the most sought after.</p></section><br>
