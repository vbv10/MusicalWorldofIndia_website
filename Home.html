				<ul>
				<li>Language:</li>
				India has 28 states and seven territories, and each has at least one official language. While the national languages are Hindi and English, there are about 22 official languages and nearly 400 living languages spoken in various parts of the country. Most of the languages of India belong to two families, Aryan and Dravidian.</p>

			<p>
				<li>Religion:</li>
				India is the birth place of  Hinduism and Buddhism. 84% of the population identifies as Hindu. About 13% of Indians are Muslim, making it one of the largest Islamic nations in the world. Christians and Sikhs make up a small percentage of the population, and there are even fewer Buddhists and Jains.
			</p>

			<p><li>Food:</li> 
			Indian cuisine is known for its large assortment of dishes and its liberal use of herbs and spices. Wheat, Basmati rice and pulses with chana (Bengal gram) are important staples of the Indian diet. The food is also rich with curries and spices. Many Hindus are vegetarians, but lamb and chicken are common in main dishes for non-vegetarians.</p>

			<p><li>Architecture:</li> 
			The most well-known example of Indian architecture is the Taj Mahal. It combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. India also has many ancient temples.</p>

			<p><li>Clothing:</li> 
			Indian clothing is closely identified with the colorful silk saris worn by many of the countryâ€™s women. Men wear a kurta, a loose shirt that is worn about knee-length. For special occasions, men wear a sherwani, which is a long coat that is buttoned up to the collar and down to the knees.</p>

			<p><li>Customs and Celebrations:</li> 
			The country celebrates Republic Day, Independence Day and Mahatma Gandhi's Birthday. There are also a number of Hindu festivals that are celebrated, including Diwali, a five-day festival known as the festival of lights and marks a time of home-based family celebrations.</p></ul>
